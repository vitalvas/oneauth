## What is the difference between insecure and secure keys?

Insecure keys are keys that were generated on a smart card and not signed by anyone.

Secure keys are keys that were generated on a smart card and signed by a certificate authority.

The main idea is whether it is possible to check the source of the key itself.

If the key is signed by a certificate authority, then it is possible to check the source of the key.

If the key is not signed by a certificate authority, then it is not possible to check the source of the key. The key can be generated by anyone.
